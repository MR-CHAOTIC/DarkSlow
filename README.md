# DarkSlow
An open-source web-content filter/blocker.

## How it works 
DarkSlow works by having you set the websites you don't want viewable, <br>
taking its content and changing it to a blocked element.

DarkSlow also has presets and "figures" to automatically, wire out the <br>
not so good sites.
